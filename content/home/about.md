# 
I am an assistant professor at the Tilburg School of Economics and Management  (Tilburg University) and am partially affiliated to the Research Unit on Politics & Public Governance (University of Antwerp). My main research focuses on the way organizations react, or can be organized to adapt, to changing environments. Prior to my academic career, I worked as a consultant for IDEA Consult (research-based consultancy).
