Public organizations are subject to a multitude of reforms. Yet, little is known on the precise effects of such continuous reforms. This research analyses the effect of such repeated structural reforms on the entrepreneurial nature of public sector organizations.

During the last decades, the public sector has witnessed wave after wave of structural reforms. Yet, this ‘reform fever’ has rarely resulted in desirable outcomes. Although to date little is known on how those repeated reforms precisely affect public sector organizations (PSOs), literature has advanced the notion that such repeated reforms can lead to reform stress (Pollitt, 2007). This is of high public relevance since reform stress is expected to negatively affect the working of these PSOs which in turn will have a detrimental effect on public services in general. As a result reforms are often claimed to be excessive, ineffective and even counterproductive. A good example hereof, is the Dutch Tax and Customs administration where the labor union argued that reform fatigue was a serious issue, threatening the working of the organization (see: http://nos.nl/artikel/2108542-werknemers-belastingdienst-zijn-reorganisatiemoe.html). This example stresses the need to gather more precise knowledge on the unintentional side effects of the constant tinkering with PSOs by policy makers.

Nevertheless, reforming the public sector in order to make it more adaptive to its (political and economic) environment is crucial. It is therefore not surprising that public sector reforms stand firmly on the agenda of policy-makers as evidenced by a continuing and growing body of reports and official studies. 

Therefore, the central ‘deliverable’ of this research is systematic knowledge on how those multiple reform waves – in interaction with formal institutional features – affect the non-bureaucratic, entrepreneurial nature of PSOs. This theoretical knowledge will hopefully improve our practical ability to make reforms work- allowing policy makers to rethink their reform strategies.
