In response to economic pressures and increasing demands on public sector performance,
subsequent waves of public sector reforms were introduced over the last decades (Pollitt &
Bouckaert, 2011). During these reform waves, public sector organizations were subject to a wide
array of structural changes such as: giving up and re-integrating tasks, the absorption of (parts of)
other organizations, the secession of parts to other organizations and changes in legal status.
Research has largely neglected the impact of such sequential and repeated structural changes on
public sector organizations. My research addresses this gap and examines the effect of an
organization’s history of structural changes on a key variable for the functioning of a public sector
organization: the way it deals with organizational autonomy. The autonomy an organization
enjoys in practice does not always equal the formal autonomy it received from political principals
(parliament, cabinet and ministers) (e.g. Maggetti, 2012). Some organizations do not fully exploit
their autonomy leading to situations whereby organizations are unable to fulfill their goals for
society. In contrast, others try to maximize and even expand it, making the organizations more
resistant to control from their political principals. The link between an organization’s history of
structural changes and its organizational autonomy will be examined using large N data as well as
small N in-depth case studies.
