abstract = "Regression analysis concerns itself with the application of mathematical statistics to the empirical measurement of relationships postulated by theory. As such regression analysis is a very powerful and useful tool for social scientists. It is however important to stress that the performance of regression analysis methods in practice depends on important underlying assumptions. In this article a short introduction to regression analysis and these assumptions is provided."
