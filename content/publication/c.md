abstract = "Within the field of public administration, the experience with large-scale international comparative survey-based research is expanding. However, while such research might render extremely interesting data for comparison and analysis, such resource and time-intensive research bring also challenges, in terms of methodological risks, data quality issues, and governance. This chapter uses the experience of the COBRA survey, the COCOPS survey, and the International Public Service Motivation survey and discusses methodological challenges, like the non-response bias, the issue of measurement invariance, common method bias, and limitations of cross-sectional data, as well as important success factors for the governance of such projects. This chapter ends with some reflections on potential strategies of the public administration community to further enhance and support such research, also toward funders and governments."
