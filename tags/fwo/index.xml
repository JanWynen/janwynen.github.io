      <description>In response to economic pressures and increasing demands on public sector performance, subsequent waves of public sector reforms were introduced over the last decades (Pollitt &amp;amp; Bouckaert, 2011). During these reform waves, public sector organizations were subject to a wide array of structural changes such as: giving up and re-integrating tasks, the absorption of (parts of) other organizations, the secession of parts to other organizations and changes in legal status. Research has largely neglected the impact of such sequential and repeated structural changes on public sector organizations.</description>

      <description>In the last decades, waves of structural reforms have been implemented in OECD countries to create more efficient public services, causing some organizations to have experienced severe and continuous trajectories of for instance mergers, splits and changes in legal form. While governments continuously impose structural reforms to improve public sector performance, we may simultaneously expect such continuous structural reforms to have detrimental side-effects, such as strong reductions in employee job satisfaction.</description>

      <description>Customer satisfaction regarding public services is often only loosely coupled to changes in actual performance. This gap between satisfaction and performance may lead to misguided reforms and may erode trust in public services. Literature shows how the incapacity of customers to assess actual performance can be attributed to the bounded rationality of customers. We know less about how public communication influences this bounded decision making that underlies the performance-satisfaction gap. With the rise of social media, the communication channels for public sector organizations have grown extensively.</description>
